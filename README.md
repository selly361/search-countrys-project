# Countrys api project

About two weeks ago, making a project like this was pretty much impossible, so being able to make this in about 10h is growth for me, learned some things and it was really fun being 100% immersed in the project. It also solidified my skills when it comes to react since i recently started learning react.
Looking forward to make another project.
